Dependency Injection

why want to use dependency injection?
what is dependency injection?

build code/objects

those objects are dependent on other objects 

The moment you calling new (creation of object) you r doing tight coupling

Maven is basically a build tool

why do we need maven?

core java application -jar<packaging>
web java application -war<packaging>


for third party api
you have to mention dependency on pom.xml file

why do we need spring framework?

web
dependency injection

Beanfactory
ApplicationContext

if we are changing java file(mainfile) you have to recompile
but when r u changing xml file  you have to only save xml file


xml based configuration
annotation based configuration
java based configuration
